# Amid neighing techs

This repo contains lots of different functions used to process and visualize the GED conflict data.

The functions are generalized, and will be useful in processing similar kinds of data, specifically to summarize event data in the form of timelines.

The UCDP ged dataset can be found here:

[UCDP georeferenced event data](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged181-csv.zip)

Run 'main.r'
This will initialize a text prompt allowing you to specify which country/countries
you want to see plots for, which time-unit to plot, and the time-range to plot.


Currently, the script requires you to have the ged data file under ./data in the
same folder as the script (in the working directory). I am working on an API-scraper
implemented in python.
