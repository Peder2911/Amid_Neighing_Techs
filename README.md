This repo contains lots of different functions used to process and visualize the GED conflict data.
The data can be found here:
[UCDP georeferenced event data](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged181-csv.zip)

Run 'main.r'
This will initialize a text prompt allowing you to specify which country/countries
you want to see plots for, which time-unit to plot, and the time-range to plot.

Currently, the script requires you to have the ged data file under ./data in the
same folder as the script (in the working directory). I am working on an API-scraper
implemented in python.

Please reach out if you have any questions:
